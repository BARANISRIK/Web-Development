    <h2>About AI</h2>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer or a machine to think and learn like a human. It means the system can understand, reason, solve problems, and sometimes even make decisions on its own.</p>

    <h2>Features of AI</h2>
    <p>AI has several important features that make it powerful. One key feature is learning, where systems can improve their performance by analyzing data, a process known as machine learning. Another feature is reasoning, which allows AI to make logical decisions based on given information. AI systems can also have perception, meaning they can see, hear, or understand their environmentâ€”for example, through image or speech recognition. Additionally, AI can interact with humans using natural language, which is seen in chatbots or voice assistants.</p>
    <h2>Examples of AI</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Google Maps- Suggests the best route using AI.</li>
    <li>Netflix- Recommends shows based on what you watch.</li>  
    <li>Voice Assistants- Like Siri or Alexa understand your voice.</li>  
    <li>Self-driving Cars- Use AI to detect roads, traffic, and pedestrians.</li>
    <li>ChatGPT- Answers your questions like a human!</li><br>
